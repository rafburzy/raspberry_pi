# raspberry_pi
Projects created with use of Raspberry Pi

Folder Mathematica contains:
- Sheet with study of the influence of the voltage closing angle on the current in a RL circuit during turning it on. Solutions are defined as functions. Version 3 is the updated version where the manipulate function has a parameter necessary for a successful export to a CDF file.
- Sheet with study of the influence of the voltage closing angle on the current in a RL circuit during turning it on. In this case solution function is achieved by solving the differential equation.
